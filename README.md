# Dental laboratory website

Pretty Dent website is a comprehensive online platform designed to streamline the workflow of this dental laboratory, offering a seamless experience for creating new products, accessing laboratory information, and scheduling appointments. This project integrates an intuitive user interface with a simple group of services, including API integration for product management. There are a feature not implemented yet, like scheduling appointments feature. The web application is currently oriented to Spanish-speaking audiences due to the laboratory is located in Villavicencio-Colombia. My sister is the owner of this dental laboratory since 2018.
